Solarized Dark Theme for Sublime Text 3
=======================================

Install by cloning to:
```
/Users/USER/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Theme-SolarizedDark
```

Then enabling at:
```
Sublime Text > Preferences > Color Schemes > Theme-SolarizedDark > SolarizedDark
```

I had a lot of trouble with the ability to override the `Theme`, so I just did an override of the global theme by using the `Default.sublime-theme` file in this package.  Because of this, if you place this theme in the `Packages` directory it will automatically change your drawer and tabs to my theme.  Pull requests are welcome to fix that correctly.  :)
