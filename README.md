```

Then enabling at:
```
Sublime Text > Preferences > Color Schemes > Theme-SolarizedDark > SolarizedDark

I had a lot of trouble with the `Theme` override aspects, I just override of the global theme by using the `Default.sublime-theme` in this package.  Because of this, if you use this theme it will automatically change your drawer and tabs to my theme.  Pull requests welcome to fix that correctly.  :)
